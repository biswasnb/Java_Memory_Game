# Java_Memory_Game

This is a console-based Memory Matching Game developed in Java. The player flips two cards each turn and tries to find all matching pairs.

## ðŸŽ® How the Game Works

- A total of 8 cards (4 pairs: A, B, C, D) are shuffled.
- The player is asked to flip two cards by entering their indices.
- If the cards match, they stay flipped.
- If not, they are flipped back.
- The game ends when all 4 pairs are found.
